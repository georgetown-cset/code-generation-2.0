I was wrong.  I apologize.\n\nAnswer: The problem is that you're using `atof` to convert the strings back to `float`s.  The problem is that `atof` is not a good function to use for converting strings to `float`s.  The problem is that `atof` is not designed to handle strings that contain more than one decimal point.  For example, the string `\"1.234\"` is converted to the `float` value `1.2340000000000001`.  The problem is that the `float` value `1.2340000000000001` is not the same as the original string `\"1.234\"`.\n\nThe problem is that `atof` is not designed to handle strings that contain more than one decimal point.
