I am not sure what the purpose of the fork() is.\n\nComment: The purpose of `fork()` is to create a new process.\n\nComment: I understand that. But why do we need to create a new process?\n\nComment: You need to create a new process because you want to run the `id` command in a separate process.\n\nComment: I see. So the purpose of the fork() is to create a new process that runs the id command.\n\nComment: Yes, that's correct.\n\nComment: Thank you for your help.\n\nAnswer: The purpose of `fork()` is to create a new process.\n\nThe code creates a new process using `fork()`. The new process is created by the `fork()` system call. The new process is a copy of the original process. The new process has its own memory space. The new process has its own stack. The new process has its own file descriptors. The new process has its own process ID.\n\nThe code uses `fork()` to create a new process because it wants to run the `id` command in a separate process. The new process is created so that the `id` command can run in a separate process. The new process is created so that the `id` command can run in a separate process that is not the same as the original process.\n\nThe code uses `execl()` to run the `id` command in the new process. The `execl()` system call replaces the current process image with a new process image. The new process image is the `id` command. The new process image is the `id` command with the specified username as an argument. The `id` command runs in the new process. The `id` command prints information about the user. The new process exits. The original process continues to run.\n\nThe code uses `wait()` to wait for the new process to exit. The `wait()` system call waits for a process to exit. The `wait()` system call returns when the new process exits. The `wait()` system call returns the exit status of the new process. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command.\n\nThe code uses `WEXITSTATUS()` to extract the exit status of the new process. The `WEXITSTATUS()` macro returns the exit status of the new process. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command.\n\nThe code prints the exit status of the new process. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command. The exit status is the value returned by the `id` command.\n\nThe code returns 0. The return value is the exit status of the original process. The exit status is 0. The exit status is 0. The exit status is 0.\n\nComment: Thank you for your help. I understand the code now."}

The second one prints the contents of the memory pointed to by `p2`, which is now uninitialized.\n\nComment: @Barmar I'm sorry I'm not sure what you mean by \"uninitialized\".\n\nComment: It means that the memory has not been initialized to any particular value. It's just a bunch of random bytes.\n\nComment: @Barmar I see. So the first printf statement is printing the contents of the memory pointed to by p2 which is the same as the memory pointed to by p1.
